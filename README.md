## Crowd Music — Collective Song Creation

Crowd Music is a real-time collaborative platform where a group of people
collectively create a song that evolves round by round.

### Core Idea
The crowd’s collective creativity + voting produces better music than
individual contributions.

### Key Features
- Real-time lyric submission & voting
- AI-powered lyric remixing
- Spectator (watch-only) mode
- Demo Mode with bot participants
- Live emoji reactions
- Host / Conductor controls
- Song recording & export

### Demo Mode
Demo Mode simulates a full session without real users by introducing bots
that submit, vote, and remix automatically.

This allows fast testing and clear demos of the full product flow.

### Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Socket.IO
- Tone.js
- OpenAI API
- SQLite (MVP persistence)
